                <h5>Filing Articles of Incorporation</h5>
                <p>Filing articles of incorporation through the State Corporation Commission's online portal is the first step to creating a Virginia corporation if you are a stock company. Non-stock companies must submit this document through postal mail.</p>
                <p>Non-stock corporations pay a $75 filing fee. The filing fee for stock corporations is $25 plus $50 for every 25,000 issued shares.</p>
                <hr>

                <h5>Choosing a Business Name</h5>
                <p>Every Virginia business entity must have a unique business name. Before registering your corporation, conduct a business entity name search to make sure the name you want is not already in use. Once you settle on a name, you can reserve it for 120 days with a $10 filing fee.</p>

                   <h5>Choosing a Registered Agent</h5>
                   <p>Your Virginia domestic corporation must have a registered agent in the state.
